The objective of the {mycomicslibrary} package is to manage your comics library.

The app can be seen there : https://connect.thinkr.fr/mycomicslibrary/

## Installation

You can install the development version of mycomicslibrary from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ymansiaux/mycomicslibrary", dependencies = TRUE)
```

This app has been developed using R 4.4.0 and Python 3.12.4.

You should install Python.

``` r
# install.packages("reticulate")
reticulate::install_python("3.12.4")
```

The dependencies, both R and Python dependencies, can be installed using `{renv}` :

``` r
# install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

It is advised to set the following environment variables in your .Renviron file:

``` r
COVERS_PATH = "path_to_app_storage/covers"
COMICS_SQL_PATH = "path_to_app_storage/db/db.sqlite"
```

`COVERS_PATH` will be used to store your books covers and `COMICS_SQL_PATH` will be used to store your comics library.

If theses environment variables are not set, the app will use temporary directories, which implies that your library and covers will be lost when you close the app.

To run the app, you can use the following command:

``` r
mycomicslibrary::run_app()
```

The app has been developed using the {shiny} package and the following ressources:
